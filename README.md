# Introduction
The [real source](https://camillemormal.com/) of this project.

This is just a part from this super beautiful and extremely unique website from Camille Mormal. What this project does is that it can use Parallax Scrolling along with
normal image scrolling to build an amazing scrolling effect. This might not make sense, but just give it a look!

## Steps
â—Ž `git clone` this repository and open the `index.html` file to view the Smooth Scrolling Effect.
